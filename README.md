# Collaboration and sharing meetup

## Description

This repository helps to manage and store a record of collaboration sessions,
meetups, and other events organised by Data Directorate software developers.

- These sessions are deliberately short, with low-pressure/low-commitment/low-barrier-to-entry,
  - We explicitly invite sharing and discussion around incomplete ideas, 
    half-baked code, and other works in progress.
  - Longer sessions with fuller-presentations and deeper-dives are also very welcome,
    where we can double-up or extend a session.

- Session ideas (work-related or otherwise!):
  - Summary of a recent project or piece of work
  - A YouTube video you found interesting
  - A new tool or library you've been using
  - A problem you're facing and would like help with
  - A new idea you've had and would like to discuss
  - Training or learning you've been doing

- Not all sessions will be recorded, but those that are will be stored in the team's internal storage space.
   - These recordings will not be shared outside the team, unless explicitly agreed by all participants.
   - This is to encourage open discussion and sharing of ideas,
     while also not excluding team members who cannot attend live.

- High level notes and resources from the sessions will be stored in this repository.
  - This is to help us keep track of what we've discussed, and to make it easier to refer back to previous sessions.
  - This is also to help us share resources and ideas with team members who cannot attend live.
